An XMPP server provides basic messaging, presence, and XML routing features. This page lists Jabber/XMPP server software that you can use to run your own XMPP service, either over the Internet or on a local area network.

> Note: The following software was not developed by the XMPP Standards Foundation and has not been formally tested for standards compliance, usability, reliability, or performance.

__See something missing?__ Any list of XMPP servers, clients or libraries will, due to the dynamic and evolving nature of the XMPP market, be out of date almost as soon as itâ€™s published. If __you are related to the project__ and spot mistakes, errors or omissions in the table below, please [submit a pull request!](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/tree/master/tools/README.rst)
