## Software Requirements

* Hugo
* Python

## Introduction to Hugo

Hugoâ€™s [quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) page is a good place to learn about the basics of Hugo (installation, project skeleton, development cycle, etc.).

## Installation instructions

Multiple types of installations are documented:

* [Local (regular)](#regular-installation)
* [Docker container](#docker-based-installation)
* [Vagrant virtual machine](#vagrant-based-installation)

### Regular installation

To run a development server on your local computer, follow these basic steps:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@github.com/xsf/xmpp.org.git
# install Hugo
cd xmpp.org
```

Running the server in development mode (reloads whenever a file is changed):

```bash
make serve
```

View at `http://localhost:1313`

### Docker-based installation

The Makefile will build the website completely by running:

```bash
make -f MakefileDocker
```

It'll do the following:

* Create a Docker image based on `DockerfileDev` which is a development environment with a complete set of dependencies ready.

* Build the website from the locally checked out xmpp.org repository (`make prepare_docker`). This includes `deploy/xsf.conf`.

For development convenience, you can run the website on port 80:

```bash
make -f MakefileDocker serve
```

### Vagrant-based installation

For your convenience, this repository ships with a basic Vagrantfile, which allows you to create virtual machine with all the dependencies required for local development.

Assuming your computer has [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed, the following will get you a running server:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@github.com/xsf/xmpp.org.git
cd xmpp.org
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/
make serve
```

Now, the website should be available at `http://localhost:1313`

## Configuration

```
<repo>
  Dockerfile / DockerfileDev
  fabfile.py
  MakefileDocker
  Makefile
  README.md
  public
    <generated files>
  content
    <website page files>
  themes
    <website theme>
```

## Local site generation

To just generate a new version (without starting up a local webserver) just do:

```bash
make publish
```

Pages will be available in the /public folder.

## Theme development

xmpp.org's theme makes use of:

* [Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2)
* [FontAwesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs)

The theme (layout and styling) can be customized in the [/themes/xmpp.org directory](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/tree/master/themes/xmpp.org).

You can directly modify styles in [themes/xmpp.org/assets/css/style.css](https://github.com/xsf/xmpp.org/blob/master/themes/xmpp.org/assets/css/style.css).
